### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | 7KHZ | 5KHZ |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | 80KHZ | 900KHZ |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 73KHZ\) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 895KHZ\) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 11.12\) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 2.92\) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 7.86 | 2.06 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
