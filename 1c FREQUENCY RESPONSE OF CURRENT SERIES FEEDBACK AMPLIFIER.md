### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | 5KHZ | 3.5KHZ |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | 1.5MHZ | 550KHZ |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 1.495MHZ\) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 546.5KHZ\) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 26.52\) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 11.12\) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 18.75  | 7.86 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
